**@wq/map-gl** provides a unified vocabulary of [MapLibre]-powered components for React on web, Android, and iOS.  The actual bindings for each environment are provided by [@wq/map-gl-web] and [@wq/map-gl-native], either or both of which should be installed in addition to @wq/map-gl.

@wq/map-gl can download and render GeoJSON and Vector Tile data from [wq.db] or any third-party service.
